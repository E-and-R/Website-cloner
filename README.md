# Website Cloner
## Built with Python, Beautifulsoup , PyQT5

A Program that downloads a website. By website we are referring to all website related files including but not limited to HTML, CSS, Javascript, pictures and other files. All HTML links in files will be localised, therefore pagination will function when running HTML files on local machine and no special modifications will be necessary to the html before deploying website. To speed up the download we have ensured the website can download multiple files at the same time by using threading.
